#RichEmu86

The goal of this project is to write an x86 architecture PC emulator in Python.
I'm currently studying object-oriented programming with Python in Udacity's
Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. So I figured this project would be
a great way to mix my love of low-level systems programming with my new love,
Python.

This project is currently in its infancy at this point. I hope to make small
updates frequently in order to get it to a point where it can run 16-bit "real
mode" machine code in the near future.

To create the 80x25 terminal window, RichEmu86 utilizes the library
```graphics.py```. The library was written by John Zelle for use with the book
"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle &
Associates).
