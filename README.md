#RichEmu86

The goal of this project is to create an x86 architecture PC emulator written in
Python. It's currently in its infancy.

To create the 80x25 terminal window, RichEmu86 utilizes the library
```graphics.py```. The library was written by John Zelle for use with the book
"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle &
Associates).
